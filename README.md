# Revise Reminder (Docker - 1.2.0)

## What is it?

A web project based on Python and Django framework. Its core idea is to ultilize Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve to help user revise learning, right now as an initial step, I implemented it on vocabularies. Users are able to add vocab on their own along with examples and interpretations. Other functionalities include:

- Word Logs for each vocab that users type to reminder themselves e.g. hints, words they got confused.
- Users define their own daily target, which is reset daily at midnight
- Similar looking words are automatically displayed next to the current word
- Fetch images from search engines using the word as a keyword (Need to set up API)
- Pronunciation generated by a TTS model by [Mozilla](https://github.com/mozilla/TTS)
- search bar supports autosuggest, powered by Elasticsearch

#### Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve Implementation

Each vocab has two counts associated with it:

- remember_count
- forget_count
  They along with timestamp are used to determine revising priorities, see the detail algorithm in vocab models.

## Django Structure

The Django project contains three Apps (what Django calls its modular components):

- users
- vocabularies
- word logs

## Core Components and Libraries

- spaCy
  - used to calculate word vector similarities to pick highlights in examples because a lemma can have many forms, a simple edit-distance algorithm doesn't cut it.
- nltk
  - used to calculate edit distance to find similar-looking vocabs
- Redis
  - DB for similar words because RDBMS is too slow for dynamic situations, similar words change due to editing/adding/deleting
- PostgreSQL
  - for all other DBs
- Nginx
- Mozilla TTS model
- Elasticsearch

## Usage

- Download TTS model from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1otOqpixEsHf7SbOZIcttv3O7pG0EadDx), put it in tts/checkpoint/, rename it to 'best_model.pth.tar'
- Build images in each folder
- Change the environment variables in db-env-public and django-env-public
- /postgresql contains some test data, execute the file in the container

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-public.yml
```

- See ManualInitialization for the parts that require manual operations

# To-do

- [✓]Pronunciation (TTS)
- [✓]auto-suggest (Elasticsearch)
- Dichotomy of Django frontend and backend, use Vue.js instead
- Mobile-friendly version
- Authentication for Nginx serving media files
- Crobjob to clean audio files against DB
